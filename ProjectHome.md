**Welcome!**

The service that Yahoo! provides to download financial, geo or weather data and search results is nice, but you have to know the right tags and symbols and how to build the URL to use it. This library will undertake this annoying task for you. Also you have a managed class environment to handle the results of queries.

For first appliance of the library look at the [Code Examples](LibraryAppliance.md)

For more details of namespaces and classes look at the [Object Browser](http://yahoo-finance-managed.googlecode.com/files/Documentation%200.11.2.0.zip)

If you want to know how to use the Yahoo! Finance API directly, look at the [Yahoo! Finance APIs](YahooFinanceAPIs.md)

Also you're able to support this project with your [Donation](Donate.md)
